## Psychology
Bruxism is often associated with stress, with specifically emotional stress and anxiety to be the main triggering factor. To avoid bruxism, these causes must be dealt with. Possible remedies and techniques:
- General stress reduction techniques, eg. meditation or mindfulness. [BruxismAcademy](https://www.bruxismacademy.com) offers multilingual courses
- Biodynamic devices. Tools that monitor bruxism behaviour and inform the user when it occurs, eg. using vibrations or notifications on your smartphone. Examples of biodynamic devides are Grindcare (product stopped), [Jawsense](https://www.jawsense.com/), [AbruxDevice](https://www.abruxdevices.com/), [Sovn](https://getsovn.com/) (previously Jawsaver), [bytesense](https://www.bytesense.us/), BiteStrip (product stopped), GrindAlert (product stopped), [Aesyra](https://www.aesyra.com/) and others.

## Pills
Drugs, stimulants, diets, can cause bruxism, or help you reduce the symptoms. 
- Reduce ☕ coffee intake or other stimulants like ecstasy and MDMA [2]
- 🌊Stay hydrated, drink enough water
- Reduce stress using drugs or supplements, eg. by using CBD oil
- Check if your body is getting enough calcium and vitamin D . Use supplements if necessary [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33413308/)
- Avoid certain (medical) drugs, like [SSRIs](https://www.spineo.org/link-between-bruxism-and-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris)

## Physical therapy
Bruxism is caused by increased jaw-muscle activity, as such specific muscle orientated treatments like stretching, trigger point treatment, dry needling can help treat it.
- Mouth excercices	
- Jaw excercises

## Plates
Occlusal splints (aka 'dental guards') work by mechanically protecting the teeth. [They typically do not reduce the bruxing activity itself](https://www.spineo.org/does-a-mouth-guard-reduce-bruxism/). In specific cases, surgerly like bite or dental Corrections can be considered.

## Others
Other options include:
- 👅Tongue surgery
