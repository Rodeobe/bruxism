## Teeth grinding remedies

An online, crowdsourced and curated overview of **treatments that can help with teeth grinding** (***bruxism***). 
We hope [cureteethgrinding.com](http://cureteethgrinding.com/) gives you your 😊 back!

We grouped the treatments in the following categories (according to the taxonomy used in [1]):
- 💊[Pills](#pills), meaning drug, food supplements, 
- 🧠[Psychology](#psychology), eg. biofeedback tools,
- 🏃‍♀️[Psysical therapy](#physical-therapy), eg. specific excercises,
- 🦷[Plates](#plates), more specifically all kinds of mouth guards, mouth correction tools,
- [Others](#others), including medical procedures.

## Psychology
Bruxism is often associated with stress, with specifically emotional stress and anxiety to be the main triggering factor. To avoid bruxism, these causes must be dealt with. Possible remedies and techniques:
- General stress reduction techniques, eg. meditation or mindfulness
- Biodynamic devices. Tools that monitor bruxism behaviour and inform the user when it occurs, eg. using vibrations or notifications on your smartphone. Examples of biodynamic devides are Jawsaver (in the form of smart earbuds), Grindcare (with a specific device), Jawsense, [bytesense](https://www.bytesense.us/), BiteStrip, GrindAlert and others.
- [Faceformer](https://faceformer.de/en/), a neurophysiological training program against bruxism.

## Pills
Drugs, stimulants, diets, can cause bruxism, or help you reduce the symptoms. 
- Reduce stress using drugs or supplements, eg. CBD oil
- Reduce ☕ coffee intake or other stimulants like [ecstasy and MDMA](https://www.spineo.org/ecstasy-mdma-and-bruxism/)
- 🌊Stay hydrated, drink enough water

- Avoid certain (medical) drugs, like [SSRIs](https://www.spineo.org/link-between-bruxism-and-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris)
- Avoid a too acidic diet (?? to be confirmed)
- Use of muscle relaxants (eg. Norflex, to be confirmed) can help you 

## Physical therapy
Bruxism is caused by increased jaw-muscle activity, as such specific muscle orientated treatments like stretching, trigger point treatment, dry needling can help treat it.
- Mouth excercices	
- Jaw excercises
- HIIT excercises

## Plates
- Occlusal splints (aka 'dental guards') work by mechanically protecting the teeth. They typically do not reduce the bruxing activity itself. In specific cases, surgerly like Bite or Dental Corrections can be considered.
- 
## Others
Other options include:
- 👅Tongue surgery
- 💉Botox injections
- 👃Nasal dilators
